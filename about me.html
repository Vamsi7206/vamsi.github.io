Thank you for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself. My name is <b>C. Vamsi</b>, and I come from <b>Eguva Reddy Palli</b>. I belong to a family of four, including myself.
I am proud to say that I recently completed my graduation in <b>Electronics and Communication Engineering</b>from <b>SRI VENKATESWARA INSTITUTION OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, Kadapa.</b> Prior to that, I completed my schooling and intermediate studies at <b>AP MODEL SCHOOL AND JUNIOR COLLEGE.</b>
In terms of skills, I have a strong command of Java and SQL for coding purposes, and I am good in HTML and CSS. These technical abilities have provided me with a solid foundation for a career in the technology field.
In the academic realm, I have participated in the prestigious <b>TEXVIN</b>Quiz Competition and, together with my team, won the first prize. Additionally, I have earned a 3 Star rank on Hackerrank, showcasing my problem-solving and programming capabilities.
Beyond academics and professional pursuits, I have diverse hobbies that keep me engaged and well-rounded. I enjoy playing outdoor games like Kabaddi, Cricket, and Volleyball, which not only keep me active but also foster team spirit. Solving puzzles is another hobby of mine, as it challenges my mind and enhances my analytical thinking.
Furthermore, I have a keen interest in poetry, which allows me to express myself creatively and explore the beauty of language.
I am enthusiastic about the possibilities that lie ahead in my career and personal growth. I am eager to contribute my skills and passion to make a positive impact in the world.
Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to any opportunities that come my way. <br> <br>
<b>Best regards,</b> <br><br>
