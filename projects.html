        Pollution of water is one of the main threats in recent times as drinking is getting contaminated and polluted.The polluted water can cause various diseases to humans and animals,which in turn affectes the life cycle of the ecosystem.If water pollution is detected in an early stage ,suitable measures can be taken and critical situations can be avoided. <br>
        To make certain the supply of pure water,the quality of the water should be examined in real-time.Smart solutions for monitoring of water pollution are getting more and more significant these days with innovation in sensors,communication ,and Internet of Things(IoT) technology. <br>
        The project proposes a cost effective and efficient IoT based smart water quality monitoring system which monitors the quality parameters uninterruptedly.The developed model is tested with three water samples and the parameters are transmitted to the cloud server for further action.
